Baslamo is an international auxiliary language: a constructed language that aims to help people all across the world communicate with each other. These languages are meant to be as easy to learn as possible, to help people connect to one another through a shared language. The ethos of Baslamo is to have a universal vocabulary with broad grammar. While memorizing words isn't all too hard, having to change the way one thinks about putting those words together is difficult. Baslamo's philosophy alleviates this by allowing people to put together words in a way that is more directly intuitive to them. Currently, Baslamo has reached a stable \"Alpha\" state, where the grammar, syntax, and derivation methods have been set in stone. See \" Development \" for more information.

In fact, this is why the name \"Baslamo\" has an ending -o; the name is a portmanteau of baso (now basa ) + saramo (now salam ).

Most are pronounced the same as in English: p, t, k \u2014 like in p ay, t ake, k ing b, d, g \u2014 like in b ay, d arn, g ame f \u2014 like in f amous m, n \u2014 like in m orning, n oon a \u2014 like in c a t or f a ther i \u2014 like in t ee th or b i t u \u2014 like in t oo th or f oo t e \u2014 like in b e t o \u2014 like in oh Never pronounce vowels as an 'uh' sound, like in b u t ! A couple are pronounced sometimes like in English, but with some variations: s \u2014 like in s at, but also like th ink, th at, and z ap v \u2014 like in v ine, but also like w ine l \u2014 like in l ake, but also like r ake And the last two are pronounced much differently than in English: x \u2014 like in ch urch or j ump j \u2014 like in y ear Stress Baslamo has no contrasting stress; there's no difference between words like per mit versus per mit , like in English. Generally, any syllable can be stressed. Examples We'll look at a few words in Baslamo and how to pronounce them: Baslamo Meaning Pronunciation jati speak YAH-tee kitap book KEE-tahp salam person SAH-lahm, SAH-rahm un one OON xeba sit CHEH-bah, JEH-bah neja thanks! NEH-yah din place DEEN fas make FAHS, FAHZ ven warm WEHN, VEHN taga day TAH-gah Capitalization and punctuation In Baslamo, there is no capitalization whatsoever; not at the beginning of sentences, in places, or names. To get rid of ambiguity, one can choose to wrap a proper name in what are called guillemets , like so: \u2039sami\u203a li til \u2039belin\u203a. \u2014 \"Sami is going to Berlin.\" You can also write it without the guillemets. sami li til belin. \u2014 \"Sami is going to Berlin.\" Beyond that, Baslamo uses other punctuation, like question marks, exclamation points, periods, and commas, imut sin! \u2014 \"Good to see you!\" ka me kan e lel? \u2014 \"Can I have it?\" me kisa, ga lel li u. \u2014 \"I think that he's there.\" as well as hyphens for some compounds. te sa no til ugal-lot ka? \u2014 \"Will you go by train?\" me gida e kesek-gida. \u2014 \"I live in an apartment.\"","title":"Lesson 1 \u2014 Pronunciation"},{"location":"guide/1_pronunciation/#lesson-1-sounds-and-spelling","text":"Baslamo's alphabet consists of 19 letters; 14 consonants and 5 vowels: p, t, k, b, d, g, f, s, x, v, l, j, m, n a, i, u, e, o","title":"Lesson 1 \u2014 Sounds and spelling"},{"location":"guide/1_pronunciation/#sounds","text":"The unique thing about Baslamo is that its sounds are able to be pronounced a variety of ways.

For now, the object preposition will always be e . Statements With these rules, the basic structure is as follows: Type Example English subject, verb, object me li jati e baslamo I'm speaking Baslamo subject, object, verb lel e ovose li esa He's eating (a) fruit noun, adjective taga ven a warm day You'll notice that the verbs in these sentences have li before them. This word describes an action that's unfinished or still happening, and always goes directly before the verb. However, you can get rid of this word in situations where it's easy to tell what the verb is, and it'll maintain the same meaning: me sin e salam. \u2014 I see a person. lel dop e me ka? \u2014 Can they help me? But be weary of verbs that don't take an object! salam ega \u2014 The man is annoyed. / The annoying man. tajam utika \u2014 The animal flees. / The cowardly animal. Questions Questions are made by putting the question particle ka at the beginning or end of a sentence; sort of like a spoken question mark. lel li kan e kitap. \u2014 He has a book. ka lel li kan e kitap? \u2014 Does he have a book? lel li kan e kitap ka? \u2014 Does he have a book? The question mark itself can be omitted, but it's best to keep it. Negatives You can negate a specific word in a sentence by putting ma before it. inaki li esa e mis. \u2014 The dog eats the meat. ma inaki li esa e mis. \u2014 The dog isn't eating the meat. inaki ma li esa e mis. \u2014 The dog isn't eating the meat. inaki li esa e ma mis. \u2014 The dog isn't eating the meat . Wait, how do you say \"the\" and \"a\"? You don't! Or, more exactly, there's no dedicated word for either of these. If you want to refer to one thing, you could use un , meaning \"one\": mama \u2014 the parent, a parent un mama \u2014 a parent, one parent And if you want to refer to some specific object, you could use lel , which means \"this\" or \"that\": umal \u2014 the apple, an apple lel umal \u2014 that specific apple What does lel even mean? In the examples above, we saw lel translated as \"he\", \"they\", and \"that\"; all of these meanings are correct! More precisely, lel means he , she , it , or they , as well as this and that . We'll see more of lel and related words in Lesson 5, as it's one of the doskamolas . Here's a few examples of the versatility of lel : lel li meti e kitap. \u2014 He/she/they place down the book. lel kitap li e mea! \u2014 This/that book is mine! tes sin e lel salam ka? \u2014 Do y'all see this/that person? Some words to start with Now that we know how to put sentences together, here's a few words you can play around with: me , te \u2014 I/me, you mes , tes \u2014 we/us, y'all lel \u2014 he/she/it/they and this/that esa \u2014 to eat, to drink; food, nourishment jati \u2014 to speak, talk; speech sin \u2014 to see, look at kitap \u2014 to read; book salam \u2014 person, man, woman mama \u2014 parent, mother, father Don't forget the important sentence-building words li and e !","title":"Lesson 2 \u2014 Sentences"},{"location":"guide/2_sentences/#lesson-2-how-to-make-a-sentence","text":"Baslamo sentences can be put together in a variety of ways, with a few rules: The one doing an action, or the subject , always goes first, Adjectives always come after the word they modify, and The one experiencing an action, or the object , always has a preposition before it.
