Baslamo is an international auxiliary language: a constructed language that aims to help people all across the world communicate with each other. These languages are meant to be as easy to learn as possible, to help people connect to one another through a shared language. The ethos of Baslamo is to have a universal vocabulary with broad grammar. While memorizing words isn't all too hard, having to change the way one thinks about putting those words together is difficult. Baslamo's philosophy alleviates this by allowing people to put together words in a way that is more directly intuitive to them. Currently, Baslamo has reached a stable \"Alpha\" state, where the grammar, syntax, and derivation methods have been set in stone. See \" Development \" for more information. The making of Baslamo What it used to be Baslamo first started out as an IAL largely inspired by Esperanto\u2014in fact, it used the same part of speech ending-vowel-rule, though it substituted -i with -u. In fact, this is why the name \"Baslamo\" has an ending -o; the name is a portmanteau of baso (now basa ) + saramo (now salam ). I moved away from this system in favor of a structure that had no part-of-speech specification, instead allowing (almost) all words to act as verbs, nouns, and/or adjectives. din baslamo \u2014 The Baslamo Discord There is an official Discord server where people can discuss and learn Baslamo.
